Allure Reporter Installation:

To install Allure Reporter, please follow the below steps:

Like any dependency installation, it can be done by:
npm install @wdio/allure-reporter --save-dev

Once done, package.json will have the dependency added:
"devDependencies": {
    	"@wdio/allure-reporter": "^7.16.8",

Allure Reporter Usage:

Configure wdio.conf.js to use allure reports. Then, update “reporters” with allure and configure the output directory.
reporters: [
    	['allure', {
    	outputDir: 'allure-results',
	}]

reporters: [
     ['allure', {
     outputDir: 'allure-results',
 }]
],
This will generate the XML file once the test execution is done as shown below (along with multiple JSON files) at the location
 given in outputDir:


Now to generate HTML from this, we need another dependency – allure-commandline that can be installed using the below command:
npm install -g allure-commandline --save-dev

Execute the below command manually:

To generate allure results:
allure generate --clean

To generate allure report:
allure open
